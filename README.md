## Milestone 1 – Elite BJJ Website

I am designing a website for a fictitious martial arts gym, specialising in offering Brazilian jiu-jitsu classes. The main goal of the website is encourage prospective customers to sign up for a free trial class, and provide information about the gym (e.g. classes available, timings, location). 

## UX

_Overview_

For the gym operators, the website needs to serve as a tool to promote the gym in a positive light, in order to attract new clients. The main objective is to attract people to sign up for the free trial class. It also needs to provide potential clients with information such as the address, details on the classes and timings, and a simple way to contact the gym for any queries.
For potential clients, the website needs to give details on what Brazilian jiu-jitsu involves, information about the instructors, and an impression of what the classes are like, in order for them to decide if they’re interested. They need practical information such as when classes take place, and where the gym is located, again to help them decide if they’re keen on joining. If they want to join, they need a simple way to sign up for a free trial via the website, or contact the gym, in case they have any questions they need answering before deciding.

**Strategy** 

The primary goal is to meet the gym owners objectives, which is to encourage potential customers to sign up for a free trial class. To do this, the website needs to present a positive impression of the club. 

**Scope** 

The overall look and feel of the website was influenced by researching websites of similar businesses, particularly other mixed martial arts gyms, along with other traditional gyms:
-	These generally have a sleek, modern feel, with vibrant colours, however they also incorporate a minimalistic design, where only two or three colours tend to be used throughout the website.
-	The content on the websites is fairly minimal, the focus is on providing high-level useful information to the users (such as info on classes), along with encouraging users to sign-up.
-	There are no complicated features used on these websites, they are simple to use and navigate through, you can usually scroll through the whole website in a matter of minutes. 
-	The websites commonly use features such as images or videos of the gyms in use, user testimonials, and the listing any unique selling points (or reasons to join the gym) to create positive impressions for the users, and further encourage them to sign up. 

With this in mind, my website will include:
-	A simple, user-friendly way for interested customers to sign up for a free trial
-	Images of the club, so customers can get a general impression of the club, and positive imagery can be used as a promotional tool to encourage the user to sign up for a trial.
-	User testimonials, so potential customers can again get a feel for the club, and again this is effective as a promotional tool to encourage the user to sign up. 
-	Some benefits of joining the club, to further encourage the user to sign up.
-	Essential practical information to help the customer decide if this club is suitable for them, including an introduction to the club and its instructors, some information on what Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes involve, the club location, and the class schedule.
-	A simple, user-friendly way for interested customers to contact the club to ask any questions. 
-	The website will be simplistic in design in line with my current capabilities.


**Structure** 

In line with my research from other similar websites, and based on the goals identified in the strategy section, the website will be structured as follows:
