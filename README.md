## Milestone 1 – Elite BJJ Website

I am designing a website for a fictitious martial arts gym, specialising in offering Brazilian jiu-jitsu classes. The main goal of the website is encourage prospective customers to sign up for a free trial class, and provide information about the gym (e.g. classes available, timings, location). 

## UX

_Overview_

For the gym operators, the website needs to serve as a tool to promote the gym in a positive light, in order to attract new clients. The main objective is to attract people to sign up for the free trial class. It also needs to provide potential clients with information such as the address, details on the classes and timings, and a simple way to contact the gym for any queries.
For potential clients, the website needs to give details on what Brazilian jiu-jitsu involves, information about the instructors, and an impression of what the classes are like, in order for them to decide if they’re interested. They need practical information such as when classes take place, and where the gym is located, again to help them decide if they’re keen on joining. If they want to join, they need a simple way to sign up for a free trial via the website, or contact the gym, in case they have any questions they need answering before deciding.

**Strategy** 

The primary goal is to meet the gym owners objectives, which is to encourage potential customers to sign up for a free trial class. To do this, the website needs to present a positive impression of the club. 

**Scope** 

The overall look and feel of the website was influenced by researching websites of similar businesses, particularly other mixed martial arts gyms, along with other traditional gyms:
-	These generally have a sleek, modern feel, with vibrant colours, however they also incorporate a minimalistic design, where only two or three colours tend to be used throughout the website.
-	The content on the websites is fairly minimal, the focus is on providing high-level useful information to the users (such as info on classes), along with encouraging users to sign-up.
-	There are no complicated features used on these websites, they are simple to use and navigate through, you can usually scroll through the whole website in a matter of minutes. 
-	The websites commonly use features such as images or videos of the gyms in use, user testimonials, and the listing of any unique selling points (or reasons to join the gym) to create positive impressions for the users, and further encourage them to sign up. 

With this in mind, my website will include:
-	A simple, user-friendly way for interested customers to sign up for a free trial.
-	Images of the club, so customers can get a general impression of the club, and positive imagery can be used as a promotional tool to encourage the user to sign up for a trial.
-	User testimonials, so potential customers can again get a feel for the club, again this is effective as a promotional tool to encourage the user to sign up. 
-	Some benefits of joining the club, to further encourage the user to sign up.
-	Essential practical information to help the customer decide if this club is suitable for them, including an introduction to the club and its instructors, some information on what Brazilian Jiu Jitsu classes involve, the club location, and the class schedule.
-	A simple, user-friendly way for interested customers to contact the club to ask any questions. 
-	The website will be simplistic in design in line with my current capabilities, and similar to other websites I've seen designed for this purpose.
- The website will be designed using a mobile first approach, it is likely the target demographic (fitness enthusiasts aged 18 onwards) will be likely to view the website on mobile devices.

**Structure** 

In line with my research from other similar websites, and based on the goals identified in the strategy section, the website will be structured as follows:

1.	Home page:

  As this will be the first page the user will see, this will incorporate the most important features identified from the scope section:
  -	Jumbotron with an enticing image, an attention grabbing headline, and a call-to-action encouraging the user to sign-up for a trial.
  -	Introductory information about the club.
  -	Bulletpoints giving reasons to join.
  -	A rotating carousel with user testimonials.
  -	A carousel is used here to keep the webpage looking dynamic, in addition to reducing real-estate on the screen (the testimonials will rotate instead of all being displayed at once).
  -	Also, another image can be included in the background, to give more positive impressions of what the club looks like in action

The idea behind this structure is the information is presented in a sequential and logical manner, as you scroll from top-to-bottom. The users attention is initially grabbed by the jumbotron. Then the user will most likely want some basic information, which they will see below the jumbotron. They are then given encouragement to sign up, in the form of the bullet points with reasons to join, and finally the user testimonials.

It provides all the high-level key information but is still simple, keeping content to a minimum, enabling the user to scroll through the whole page quickly and easily.

2.	Header:

-	The header will contain the club logo on the left-hand side, which will be an active link back to the home page for ease of use.
-	The right-hand side will contain links to the other pages in the site, for ease of use.
-	The header will remain fixed to the top of the page, to give familiarity to the user, and provide them with a quick way to navigate to any of the other pages.

3.	Footer:

-	The footer will contain links to other social media accounts, this is placed at the end as logically, as the user has absorbed the initial information in each page, they may want to research the club further via its social media accounts.

4.	About:

After taking in the initial information on the home page, the user may want to find out further detail on the club, so sequentially this is placed on the next ‘about’ page: 
-	An image, overlayed with some general information about jiu-jitsu, for those wanting to learn more. 
-	The image will give a visual representation of jiu-jitsu to help users understand what classes involve.
-	The layout is similar to the home page, for familiarity. 
-	Placing the text over the image is efficient in reducing screen real-estate, as the user can see both a visual image of jiu-jitsu and some descriptive text in the same section.
-	Below this will be information on the instructors, as users will want details on who gives the classes, this includes pictures of the instructors.
-	Finally the last section on the page will contain the class timings.

5.	Gallery:

This page is included to include some more images about the club, to further enhance the positive impression of the club, and enable the user to get more of a feel for the club. 

However, use of positive imagery can be effective in enticing potential customers to this type of business, hence it is worth dedicating a page to photos of the club in actions.

-	The images are displayed in a “stacked” format, this is to keep with the efficient presentation throughout the site, where space is optimally used (the user can immediate see - variety of different images, there is no need to ‘click’ anywhere to move from one photo to the next, you simply scroll up or down)
-	In addition, this presentation style is familiar with other social media sites like Instagram, so this will be a familiar format to the user 

6.	Contact:

This is included as the last page, as contact pages are generally the last page or section on a website. After the user has digested the previous information, the next logical step for the user would be to see where the club is located, and contact the club if there are any queries. Contact pages generally have the location details and/or a contact form, hence these two features are included on this page.

-	The top of the page contains a map showing the location, along with the actual address.
-	The bottom of the page contains a form, for the user to easily be able to contact the club should they have any queries.
-	The form will be pre-populated with placeholder text, so it is intuitive for the user to see how to fill in the form.

**Surface** 

-	The header and footer will be the same colour.
-	The colour scheme will use 3 colours, black, white and red.
-	Red has been used following research, where I found red invokes feelings of excitement, and wanting to take action, which is suited to a martial arts gym (source: https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/website-color-palettes/).
-	The red is used for items where we want to draw the users attention, for example the main CTA button.
- The fonts used will be Oswald and Lato from Google Fonts, this is following research I did where I found these were in the top 5 used fonts for gym websites (source: https://www.ilovewp.com/resources/wordpress-for-gyms/most-used-google-fonts-on-gym-websites/). In addition, having seen how effective this font combination looked on the Code Institute 'Love Running' website, and given the similarites in the type of websites, I decided it would be ideal for use here.
-	For smaller displays, the menu will change to a burger bar, for ease of use, and some sections will scroll from top-to-bottom instrad of left-to-right (i.e. the the ‘Why Join?’ bulletpoints and the instructors/class timetable on the about page).
-	Similarly, the columns of images displayed on the gallery page will reduce for ease-of-use and cleaner presentation.

## Features

_Existing_

_Responsiveness_

Used the inspect function to examine all pages of the website in all devices:
-	On the about page I removed the ‘About BJJ’ header for smaller screens, as I found it wasn’t displaying properly.
-	I had to experiment with the contact form to get it to display fully on smaller screens, I ended up adding padding and changing the font-size of the ‘Get in touch’ header to ensure there were no issues.

However, following this, I tested the website on actual mobile devices I have at home (iPhone SE and iPhone 7). I found there were some issues which weren’t being picked up by the inspect function on developer tools:
-	The jumbotron images (on the home and about pages) were not being displayed properly, after searching on google I found a resolution here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43808272/jumbotron-background-image-is-not-responsive
-	I found on the smaller iPhone SE there were still some display issues, the text in the ‘About BJJ’ container was still overflowing, so some of the text was hidden behind the navbar, similarly the ‘Contact’ form was overflowing so the submit button overlapped the footer. To resolve this, I shortened the text in both of these sections, I decided it was feasible to do this without affecting the website presentation or functionality. 

I ensured all features which were designed to be worked properly by changing the screen size and using the inspect function on developer tools, i.e. the ‘Why Join’ and ‘Pricing’ sections on the home page, the ‘Instructors’ section on the about page, the images on the gallery page, and the map and address on the ‘contact’ page.

_HTML/CSS Code Validator_

All code passed validation tests from the [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) validation websites.

_Images_

I used [Tiny Png](https://tinypng.com/) to compress the images, once done this reduced the loading time for the website.

## Deployment

The website code was written in Gitpod (IDE). The code was stored in Github (repository).

To deploy the website, under the Github repository, I went to Settings > Github Pages > Chose ‘master’ branch, after which the website was deployed.

You can run the code locally by clicking on the ‘code’ button on my repository, here is the link: [MS1_EliteBJJ](https://github.com/upeshp/MS1_EliteBJJ)
